# There are two methods to define the modulo operator.

x = 20 
y = 10
print(x % y)

""" Answer = """

"""In modulo we only care about the remainder value, and that remainder value is
 better if its near to 0."""
"""Explanation: x = 10 and y = 20, x % y (x Modulo y), which means divide X/Y â‰¡ R"""
